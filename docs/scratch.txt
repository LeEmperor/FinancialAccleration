Project Outlines
    Build a series of hardware-implementable cores for trading acceleration

    Item 1: 
        Data transmission protocols and formatting

        Take in trading data over ethernet and turn it into a specific format
        
        Required items:
            (software) module to stream the data to the FPGA
                implemented in Pyton or C++?
            (hardware) module to receive the data from ethernet
                Basic test is to display some basic data from that into a screen or LED array to verify correctness & latency requirements
